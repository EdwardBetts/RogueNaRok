RogueNaRok is an algorithm for the identification of rogue taxa in a tree set.

How do I install it?

Download the code and run the "make" command.

For a parallel version of the RogueNaRok algorithm, use "make
mode=parallel". Note that, the parallel version requires the
pthreads-library. Running one of the programs without arguments will
trigger the help message. Just follow the instructions.
