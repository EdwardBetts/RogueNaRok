RogueNaRok is an algorithm for the identification of rogue taxa in a tree set.

How do I install it?

Download the code and run the "make" command.

For a parallel version of the RogueNaRok algorithm, use "make
mode=parallel". Note that, the parallel version requires the
pthreads-library. Running one of the programs without arguments will
trigger the help message. Just follow the instructions.

More info is available on
https://github.com/aberer/RogueNaRok/wiki/RogueNaRok . Also, use this
site for reporting bugs or ask questions of how to employ RogueNaRok.

QUICK START: 
Have a look in the "example"-directory. For calling RogueNaRok, simply execute  
./RogueNaRok -i example/150.bs  -n id
in the command line. 

Searching for rogues based on bootstrap values drawn onto a ML tree
(from a bootstrap tree set) is done with
 ./RogueNaRok -i example/150.bs -t example/150.tre -n id

Also notice the script utils/pruneWrapper.sh. It facilitates the
process of obtaining pruned trees from the RogueNaRok search. Call
without arguments and follow the instructions in the help message.
